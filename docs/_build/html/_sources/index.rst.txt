Roadmap:
 * Auto build documentation: I want the ability to produce
   documentation that describes the HDF5 file layout, without
   referencing the Python specification. Documentation strings of
   elements should flow through to the documentation.
 * Units: I want to fully support Pint units on all elements,
   including passing it through to documentation.
 * Hypothesis: I want to generate dump/load tests using Hypothesis.

Indices and tables
