* synchrotron
 * lots of sensors
 * lots of data
* HDF files
 * One file, with structure
 * Can think of it like a zip file
 * Has groups, which are basically directories/folders
 * Has datasets, which are arrays
 * Has key/value metadata, which can be tagged
* Users ideally want to take away one file
* Worked with one of the beamline scientists to lay out the format of the of the experiment file 
* Ended up with  wall of text that described the layout
* But still no code
* Had the idea of creating an ORM type library but it targets HDF rather than 
* HDF5
* Pydantic
* h5pydantic
* TODO
* weird whacky things about hdf5
 * does not have a date/time type
  * well it does, but it's deprecated for being wrong
 * pint, uncertainties
* automatic docs
