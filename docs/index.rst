Design:
 The h5pydantic project is designed to make it possible to specify a
 HDF5 file layout by specifying models through Python, in a similar
 way that Object Relation Mappers map from Python classes to SQL
 tables.

The project makes use h5py library to create and load HDF5 files, and
the pydantic library to handle creating Python models.

The name of the project comes from creating a portmanteau of
h5py and pydantic.
