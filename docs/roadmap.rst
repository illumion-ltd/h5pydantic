Roadmap
======================================

 * Auto build documentation: I want the ability to produce
   documentation that describes the HDF5 file layout, without
   referencing the Python specification. Documentation strings of
   elements should flow through to the documentation.
 * Units: I want to fully support Pint units on all elements,
   including passing it through to documentation.
 * Hypothesis: I want to generate dump/load tests using Hypothesis.
 * Versioning: provide tool/guidance to support versioning of
   specifications, and loading of old formats.
 * Handle appendices data, e.g. user supplied sample environments,
   somehow, referenced? linked? external data sources?
 * Provide a traversal API or example to ease making exporters to
   other formats.
